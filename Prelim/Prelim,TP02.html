              <h2>-This report aims to give an overview of the current state of the lab sample series of microprocessors, 
                noting problems found during testing and suggesting fixes to these problems. 
                The paper discusses the bad registers that were discovered in three out of ten microprocessors and 
                describes the possible repercussions of sending out defective units.</h2>

                <b><p style="font-size:xx-large;">Problem</p></b>
                  <h2>-Our team tested the lab sample series and found that 3 out of 10 microprocessors had defective registers. 
                    Data corruption, decreased performance, and system instability can all be caused by defective registers. 
                    These faulty microprocessors could cause customer unhappiness, higher support expenses, and reputational harm to the organization.</h2>
