  <h2><b><center>In your own words, compare and contrast the different implementations of parallelism in a microprocessor system in at least five (5) sentences. (15 points)</center></b></h2>
            <br>
            <h3>The parallelism has 2 parts, it is the Instruction-Level Parallelism, and Thread-Level Parallelism. Parallelism is very important part of CPU, as this helps the CPU do many task at simultaneously without taking a break. 
                The difference of them all is how many can they operate simultaneously and what kind of task can they do. 
                ILP speeds up the execution of the instructions between the CPU and main memory and also the computation of arithmetic. 
                Thread-Level Parallelism consist of Explicit multithreading, this issues multiple threads in one cycle, 
                the next is implicit multithreading which is implicitly generating the hardware of the compiler</h3>
