            <h3>The difference of it is that Interference can go from anywhere, this emits all sorts of radio waves in the air. 
                Since radio frequency interference can go anywhere it can mostly affect multiple frequencies simultaneously resulting to interference. 
                It can go to other sorts of objects like conductive materials, or even air. Crosstalk is a type of interference and interference is a natural phenomenon. 
                Both of them are interference but they are not the same, they differ on things on the way they interefere witht the frequencies.</h3>
