        <h1><b>Technology Specifications</b></h1>
        <ul>
            <b> <h2><li>Year Developed</li></b></h2>
            <p style="font-size:large;">-Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) is the bus architecture that was introduced as an 8-bit bus with the original IBM PC in 1981.  
                I/O buses have evolved over decades to accommodate the growing complexity of computer systems.</p><br>

            <b> <h2> <li>Speed (per unit)</li></b></h2>
            <p style="font-size:large;">-Both kinds of I/O bus networks have transmission speeds that range from 1 to 2.5 megabits per second. 
                Nevertheless, in the time it takes a process bus network to provide a single, huge information packet from a single field device, 
                a device bus network can transmit numerous information packets from numerous field devices.</p><br>    

            <b> <h2><li>Voltages Used</li></b></h2>

            <p style="font-size:large;"> -I/O buses have varying voltage levels that vary according on the attached device and interface standard. 
                Stable power delivery and device compatibility are guaranteed by on-board voltage regulators. 
                For instance, USB interfaces often run at 5 volts to supply power to connected devices.</p><br>
            </ul>

            <h1><b>Bus Purpose and Function</b></h1> 
            <p style="font-size:large;">The peripheral devices (keyboard, mouse, and flash drives) are connected to the central processing unit (CPU) through input/output, or extension buses. 
                A bridge that is built in the CPU chipset connects the system bus and I/O busses. 
                I/O interfaces are primarily used for data transmission, reception, device enumeration, power management, and hot-swapping.</p>   <br>
                
                <h1><b>Conclusion</b></h1>     
                <p style="font-size:large;">In conclusion, every bus is important and they have a role to play inside the CPU. 
                    They are the ones who facilitate and make a proper connections inside the machine. 
                    Without this buse especially with the I/O bus the machine will not work properly. 
                    They are the one who is enabling a good connevtivity, data transfer, and device controls in upgrading the usability and versatility of the computer that we have. 
                    It plays a very crucial role in computer systems because they are the one who will communicate with the other peripheral devices. </p>
